Add totally blank page template for any themes used. No header, no sidebar, no footer.

== Description ==

This plugin will add totally blank page template for any themes used. No header, no sidebar, no footer.

Any page using the template will only display the content, but will load everything included in the wp_head(), wp_body_open and wp_footer(), so all scripts and styles should load as normal.

This is great for page builders (Divi, Elementor, Beaver Builder, etc), landing pages and squeeze pages.
